The idea is great. Using deep learning is interesting and if you (we) are
successful in this project you (we) could write a paper for a conference (if
you are interested). The only concern I have is the eye-tracking part. Is that
info available as part of the dataset? or are you planning on doing this
yourself?

If the data is there, go for it.
